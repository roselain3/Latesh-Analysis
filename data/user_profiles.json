    "description": "I’m a robotics lead, programmer, and builder of systems—both in code and in life. Over two years in FRC Team 201, I’ve led projects in Python, C++, and Java, mentored teammates, and taught SAT prep. I enjoy the engineering challenge, but what keeps me going is the responsibility—I know people depend on me, and I take that seriously.\n\nOutside of robotics, I’m someone who’s seen a lot and felt even more. I’ve been in relationships that taught me to be cautious, maybe even distant. I’ve learned to change how I interact depending on who I’m around, and I often bottle up my own struggles—except with my sisters, who are the only people I trust completely. I’m not big on phone calls, I prefer texting, and only a few people have that unrestricted access to me.\n\nTo cope, I’ve built a whole AI system around myself to filter out hate, negativity, and energy that drains me. I know I’m not perfect, and I’ve even been accused of using AI too much—funny, because I’m probably one of the few people who actually use it with intention, not just convenience.\n\nI care deeply, even if I don’t always show it. I fear losing friends, and I try not to get involved in problems I can’t solve. But I’m always here, learning, building, and trying to protect the version of me I’ve worked hard to grow into.",

    "description": "Outstanding musician playing 4 instruments,\nOwns 2 cats\nTeam 201 Programming lead, drive team member\nseriously skilled at fortnite battle royals, robotics whiz, code-slinging strategist, looping pedal enthusiast, cat-to-human alchemist, always-on learner, FRC mastermind, formatting perfectionist, and the guy who somehow makes debugging look cool Clifford S. is a versatile and driven student with a strong focus on robotics, programming, and technical problem-solving. He’s been actively involved in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), where he has developed a solid understanding of Java, WPILib, and the architecture of modern robot control systems. From subsystems like elevators and turrets to implementing state machines and path planning, Clifford shows a clear aptitude for thinking through both the logic and structure of competitive robotics programming. In addition to his technical skills, Clifford demonstrates a strong sense of initiative and leadership. He has taken an interest in team dynamics, communication, and documentation, often working to clarify roles within his robotics team and improve training materials for others. He values precision and accessibility in his work, whether he’s naming code repositories or helping others understand programming fundamentals like variable types and class structure. Outside of robotics, Clifford also explores creative interests, particularly in music and digital design. He’s shown curiosity about live looping setups, indie rock bands, and performance techniques, blending his technical mindset with artistic expression. This same creativity shows up in playful projects like visual edits, logo design, and even imaginative transformations—like turning his cat into a human character. Clifford has also developed experience with a range of technical tools beyond robotics, including Git, Node.js, MDX, and VS Code. He regularly seeks out deeper understanding of how things work and isn’t afraid to dive into everything from stash management in Git to embedding images in code-based documentation. His approach to learning is hands-on and iterative, often balancing attention to detail with broader project goals.Overall, Clifford S. stands out as a curious and well-rounded individual who bridges the gap between engineering precision and creative exploration. He brings a thoughtful, motivated attitude to every project—whether it’s guiding a robot across the field or formatting a perfectly styled presentation. His work reflects a blend of technical rigor, creative problem-solving, and a genuine enthusiasm for learning.",

I’ve got two dogs: Charlotte, who’s definitely my favorite, and Willy, a rescue who kind of bites me sometimes, so I’m a little scared of him. This is my second year in FEDS Robotics as a programmer, and I want to be on drive team. When I’m into something, I actually put effort into it. I’m not afraid to ask for help, and once someone tells me something, I usually don’t need to be reminded again. I know when to take things seriously and when it’s okay to laugh stuff off. I’m outgoing, kind of chaotic in a fun way, and I get a weird amount of joy from mildly irritating people — nothing mean, just enough to keep things interesting.",
