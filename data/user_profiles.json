    "description": "I’m a robotics lead, programmer, and builder of systems—both in code and in life. Over two years in FRC Team 201, I’ve led projects in Python, C++, and Java, mentored teammates, and taught SAT prep. I enjoy the engineering challenge, but what keeps me going is the responsibility—I know people depend on me, and I take that seriously.\n\nOutside of robotics, I’m someone who’s seen a lot and felt even more. I’ve been in relationships that taught me to be cautious, maybe even distant. I’ve learned to change how I interact depending on who I’m around, and I often bottle up my own struggles—except with my sisters, who are the only people I trust completely. I’m not big on phone calls, I prefer texting, and only a few people have that unrestricted access to me.\n\nTo cope, I’ve built a whole AI system around myself to filter out hate, negativity, and energy that drains me. I know I’m not perfect, and I’ve even been accused of using AI too much—funny, because I’m probably one of the few people who actually use it with intention, not just convenience.\n\nI care deeply, even if I don’t always show it. I fear losing friends, and I try not to get involved in problems I can’t solve. But I’m always here, learning, building, and trying to protect the version of me I’ve worked hard to grow into.",

    "description": "I’m a blonde American, about 4'11\", and mostly pretty patient. I’d call myself an ambivert — I like being around people. I’ve got two dogs: Charlotte, who’s definitely my favorite, and Willy, a rescue who kind of bites me sometimes, so I’m a little scared of him. This is my second year in FEDS Robotics as a programmer, and I want to be on drive team. When I’m into something, I actually put effort into it. I’m not afraid to ask for help, and once someone tells me something, I usually don’t need to be reminded again. I know when to take things seriously and when it’s okay to laugh stuff off. I’m outgoing, kind of chaotic in a fun way, and I get a weird amount of joy from mildly irritating people — nothing mean, just enough to keep things interesting.",
